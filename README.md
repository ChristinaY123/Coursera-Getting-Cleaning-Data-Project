# Coursera-Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

The script run_analysis.R has been created to process the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in the following procedures:

(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

(4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
(5) Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
